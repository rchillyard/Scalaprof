I call our world Flatland, not because we call it so,
but to make its nature clearer to you, my happy
readers, who are privileged to live in Space.

Imagine a vast sheet of paper on which straight
Lines, Triangles, Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons,
and other figures, instead of remaining fixed in
their places, move freely about, on or in the surface,
but without the power of rising above or sinking
below it, very much like shadows—only hard with
luminous edges—and you will then have a pretty
correct notion of my country and countrymen. Alas,
a few years ago, I should have said my universe
but now my mind has been opened to higher views
of things.

In such a country, you will perceive at once that it
is impossible that there should be anything of what
you call a solid kind; but I dare say you will suppose
that we could at least distinguish by sight the
/p
Triangles, Squares, and other figures, moving about
as I have described them. On the contrary, we could
see nothing of the kind, not at least so as to distinguish
one figure from another. Nothing was visible, nor could be visible,
to us, except Straight Lines;
and the necessity of this I will speedily demonstrate.

Place a penny on the middle of one of your tables in
Space; and leaning over it, look down upon it.
It will appear a circle.

But now, drawing back to the edge of the table,
gradually lower your eye thus bringing yourself
more and more into the condition of the inhabitants
of Flatland, and you will find the penny
becoming more and more oval to your view, and at
last when you have placed your eye exactly on the
edge of the table so that you are, as it were, actually
a Flatlander, the penny will then have ceased to
appear oval at all, and will have become, so far as
you can see, a straight line.
